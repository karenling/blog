            Hi! My name is <strong>Karen</strong> and <strong>Twinkie</strong> is my amazing friend, who happens to be a
            dog. This blog was created as a way to keep my thoughts and write about my adventures
            with Twinkie.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a <strong>software engineer</strong> with a love for front end. Outside of coding,
            I dabble in photography, and eating carbs. I think <strong>focaccia bread</strong>{'\n'}
            is fantastic, Iâ€™ve never turned down a <strong>red velvet cupcake</strong> or{'\n'}
            <strong>banana or coconut cream pie</strong>, and I love{'\n'}
            <strong>Japanese ramen</strong>.{'\n'}
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Twinkie</strong>, on the otherhand, prefers liver and steak. Unfortunately,
            she is diabetic, so treats are very limited. ðŸ˜”
